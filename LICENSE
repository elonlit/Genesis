THE HOLY LICENSE

                        Version Last, 11 Av 5782

  Copyright (C) 5782 Elon Litman. All rights reserved.

  To whom it may concern,

  The following license applies to all of the material contained on the 
server labeled "Genesis" that is currently available for public access, 
as well as any material that may be added to the server in the future.

  This license governs the use of the Genesis programming language and its 
Software. The term "Genesis Language" refers to any material contained 
on the server labeled "Genesis" that is currently available for public 
access. The category of "Genesis Software" includes, but is not limited 
to, systems Software written in Genesis, application Software written in
Genesis, which characterize Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products, 
Software as a Service (SaaS) products, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
or Best-in-Class products, and Genesis-based Operating Systems, and 
example works of Genesis that may be added to the server in the future.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  The Holy License is a free, copyleft license for
Software and other kinds of works.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  If, as a consequence of a secular court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by secular court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all. For example, if a patent License would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would
be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
protect their rights.

  You may not apply the terms of this License to prohibit
modification of the terms of this License or to restrict the
authors' rights to sublicense through multiple terms of this
License.
